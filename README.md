# 3D-Time-Geoviz-Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains materials for the "3D and Time Geovisualization" assignment, part of the "Extraction & Dissemination of Geo Information (2023-2A)" course in the MSc Geoinformatics program at ITC, University of Twente.

## Content
Included are Python scripts for processing Movebank's bird tracking CSV data, generating interactive 3D visualizations with Plotly, and accompanying documentation that provides insights into avian movement patterns.
Additionally, the package contains HTML and CSS files for publishing the visualization outputs on the web via GitHub Pages.

## Academic Context
This work showcases data manipulation, spatial analysis, and advanced visualization techniques within an academic framework, demonstrating practical applications of geoinformatics.
