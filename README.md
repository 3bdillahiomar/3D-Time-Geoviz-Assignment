# 3D-Time-Geoviz-Assignment
This repository houses the project files for the 3D and Time Geovisualization Assignment. It includes scripts for data processing and visualization, interactive 3D models of bird movement patterns, and associated documentation. 

The repository is structured to guide you through the journey from raw Movebank CSV data to polished, interactive 3D scatter plots using Python, pandas, and Plotly. 

It serves as a comprehensive showcase of data manipulation, transformation, and advanced visualization techniques.
